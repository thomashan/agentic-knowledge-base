# Agentic Knowledge Base

* Autonomous AI-powered knowledge base for research and documentation*

As part of building [Agentic](https://github.com/thomashan/agentic) the research and documentation was quite slow.
To speed up the process, I built an AI-powered knowledge base that can research and document any topic.
As always, I will be dog fooding the system.

I believe this knowledge base will be a valuable resource for anyone who wants to perform research and documentation tasks more efficiently.
Currently, it is in the early stages of development, and it's not designed to be used at an enterprise scale.
But it will be helpful for managing research and documentation tasks at a personal level.
