### Implementation Plan

To implement the orchestrator logic with sufficient abstraction to support both CrewAI and LangChain frameworks, while starting with CrewAI as the initial implementation, we'll follow a structured approach. The goal is
to keep framework-agnostic logic (e.g., interfaces and shared utilities) in `app/agents/core/`, and place framework-specific orchestrator implementations in `app/agents/orchestrator/crewai/` and
`app/agents/orchestrator/langchain/`. This ensures modularity, allowing easy switching or extension between frameworks without altering core business logic.

The plan focuses on the orchestrator and its abstractions, avoiding any agent-specific details (e.g., no individual agent classes or behaviors in `app/agents/`). We'll define minimal ABCs to capture the essence of
orchestration: initializing the system, configuring tasks/workflows, executing them, and handling outputs. This abstraction level is "enough" to support both frameworks, as CrewAI emphasizes crew-based task
orchestration, while LangChain focuses on chain/reactor-style workflowsâ€” the ABCs will bridge these by defining common entry points.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Set Up Directory Structure Refinements**:
    - Ensure `app/agents/core/` has files for ABCs and any shared utilities (e.g., add `orchestrator.py` for ABC definitions).
    - In `app/agents/orchestrator/`, add a top-level `__init__.py` for importing and a factory function to select implementations.
    - In `app/agents/orchestrator/crewai/`, add `orchestrator.py` for the CrewAI-specific class.
    - In `app/agents/orchestrator/langchain/`, add `orchestrator.py` as a stub (for future implementation), inheriting from the ABC.

2. **Define Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in `app/agents/core/`**:
    - Create `AbstractOrchestrator` as the primary ABC, defining framework-agnostic methods for orchestration lifecycle (e.g., init, configure, run).
    - If needed, add supporting ABCs like `AbstractTask` for task definitions (kept minimal and agnostic, focusing on inputs/outputs rather than agent internals).
    - Include docstrings for each ABC and method to document purpose, parameters, and expected behavior.
    - Add any shared utilities (e.g., error handling or config parsing) in a separate file like `utils.py`.

3. **Implement CrewAI-Specific Orchestrator**:
    - In `app/agents/orchestrator/crewai/orchestrator.py`, create `CrewAIOrchestrator` inheriting from `AbstractOrchestrator`.
    - Map ABC methods to CrewAI concepts: e.g., `configure` sets up crews/tasks, `run` kicks off the crew.
    - Use CrewAI libraries (assume installed via project dependencies) for internal logic.
    - Handle CrewAI-specific configurations (e.g., agent lists, task sequences) but keep them encapsulated.

4. **Stub LangChain-Specific Orchestrator**:
    - In `app/agents/orchestrator/langchain/orchestrator.py`, create `LangChainOrchestrator` inheriting from `AbstractOrchestrator`.
    - Implement stubs (e.g., raise NotImplementedError) for methods, to be filled in later.
    - Ensure it aligns with LangChain's chain-based orchestration (e.g., `run` might invoke a chain or agent executor).

5. **Add Factory and Entry Points in `app/agents/orchestrator/__init__.py`**:
    - Create a factory function (e.g., `get_orchestrator(framework: str) -> AbstractOrchestrator`) that returns the appropriate implementation (default to 'crewai').
    - This allows higher-level app code to use the orchestrator without knowing the framework.

6. **Testing and Integration**:
    - Write unit tests for the ABCs (e.g., ensure subclasses implement all abstract methods).
    - Integrate with the broader app by importing the factory in higher-level modules.
    - Initially test with CrewAI: mock tasks/configs and verify execution.
    - Ensure extensibility: adding LangChain support should only require filling in the stubs without changing core or other implementations.

7. **Documentation and Best Practices**:
    - Add inline comments and docstrings throughout.
    - Follow Python best practices: type hints, PEP8, and dependency injection for configs.
    - Version control: Commit ABCs first, then CrewAI impl, then stubs.

This plan ensures the system is framework-agnostic at the core, with initial focus on CrewAI, and scalable for LangChain.

### ABC Definitions and Documentation

Below are the proposed ABC definitions for the core and orchestrator-agnostic interfaces. These will be placed in `app/agents/core/orchestrator.py`. I've included full code snippets with docstrings for clarity. The
abstractions are kept lightweight: `AbstractOrchestrator` handles the main lifecycle, and `AbstractTask` provides a simple task interface (agnostic to frameworks, focusing on inputs/outputs for orchestration).
