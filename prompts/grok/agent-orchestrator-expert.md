### Overview of the System

The autonomous RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge base system will leverage a multi-agent architecture to manage, expand, and query a dynamic knowledge base. The system will use open-source tools to ensure
accessibility and customizability. Key components include:

- **Knowledge Base**: A vector database storing embeddings of documents, facts, and metadata for efficient retrieval.
- **Agents**: Specialized autonomous units that perform specific functions, coordinated by an orchestrator.
- **Orchestrator**: The central component that routes tasks, manages agent interactions, maintains system state, and ensures goal-directed behavior.
- **Open-Source Tools**:
    - LLM integration: Hugging Face Transformers or Ollama for local models (e.g., Llama 3 or Mistral).
    - Vector DB: Chroma or FAISS for embedding storage and similarity search.
    - Web Scraping/Search: BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for scraping; DuckDuckGo or Serper for search (if free tiers suffice) or custom Selenium-based tools.
    - Agent Framework: LangChain or Haystack for agent building blocks, with LangGraph for orchestration workflows.
    - Embeddings: Sentence-Transformers for generating vector representations.

The system will operate autonomously, handling tasks like ingesting new knowledge, refining queries, planning complex operations, and generating responses augmented by retrieved data. The orchestrator will be implemented
as a stateful workflow engine, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.

### Agent Roles and Responsibilities

Each agent will be defined with clear inputs, outputs, and tools. Agent-specific logic will reside in their respective subdirectories under `app/agents/`, inheriting from abstract base classes in `app/agents/core/`.
Agents will be prompt-engineered for their roles, using few-shot examples where applicable.

1. **Planners Agent** (`app/agents/planner/`):
    - Role: Decompose high-level user goals into actionable sub-tasks, create execution plans, and prioritize steps.
    - Inputs: User query or high-level goal, current system state.
    - Outputs: A structured plan (e.g., list of sub-tasks with dependencies).
    - Tools: None directly; relies on reasoning via LLM.
    - Key Behaviors: Handle branching logic (e.g., if-then scenarios), estimate task complexity, and adapt plans based on feedback from other agents.

2. **Intelligence Agent** (`app/agents/intelligence/`):
    - Role: Provide reasoning, decision-making, and inference to evaluate plans, resolve ambiguities, or synthesize insights from data.
    - Inputs: Plan from planners, data from other agents, or partial results.
    - Outputs: Decisions (e.g., approve/reject plan), refined queries, or synthesized knowledge.
    - Tools: Basic math/logic utilities if needed (e.g., via SymPy integration).
    - Key Behaviors: Detect inconsistencies, perform chain-of-thought reasoning, and escalate complex decisions back to the orchestrator.

3. **Knowledge Agent** (`app/agents/knowledge/`):
    - Role: Manage the knowledge base by ingesting, updating, or pruning entries to maintain accuracy and relevance.
    - Inputs: New data from research, updates from intelligence, or queries for maintenance.
    - Outputs: Confirmation of ingestion/update, or summaries of knowledge base status.
    - Tools: Vector DB interactions (e.g., via Chroma client).
    - Key Behaviors: Handle deduplication, metadata tagging, and periodic knowledge refinement (e.g., summarizing clusters of similar entries).

4. **Research Agent** (`app/agents/research/`):
    - Role: Gather external information to expand the knowledge base, such as web searches, scraping, or API queries.
    - Inputs: Research tasks from planners or intelligence (e.g., "find latest on topic X").
    - Outputs: Raw or processed data (e.g., articles, facts) ready for ingestion.
    - Tools: Web search/scraping integrations.
    - Key Behaviors: Filter for credible sources, handle pagination, and summarize findings to avoid overwhelming the system.

5. **Retrieval Agent** (`app/agents/retrieval/`):
    - Role: Query the knowledge base for relevant information to augment generation tasks.
    - Inputs: Query from intelligence or planners.
    - Outputs: Ranked list of relevant chunks/embeddings with context.
    - Tools: Vector similarity search.
    - Key Behaviors: Support hybrid search (semantic + keyword), reranking for relevance, and handling query expansion.

### Orchestrator Architecture

The orchestrator will be the core coordinator, implemented in `app/agents/orchestrator/`. It will use a graph-based workflow (e.g., via LangGraph) to model agent interactions as nodes and edges, allowing for dynamic
routing. Abstract logic like base agent interfaces, state management, and error handling will be in `app/agents/core/`.

- **Core Components**:
    - **State Management**: A shared state object (e.g., a dictionary or Pydantic model) tracking task progress, agent outputs, history, and knowledge base metadata. This ensures persistence across agent calls.
    - **Routing Logic**: Conditional routing based on task type, agent outputs, or thresholds (e.g., if retrieval confidence is low, route to research).
    - **Error Handling**: Retry mechanisms, fallback to human-in-the-loop if needed, and logging for debugging.
    - **Termination Conditions**: Define when a workflow completes (e.g., goal achieved) or loops (e.g., max iterations).

- **Integration Points**:
    - Use `app/integration/llm/` for LLM calls shared across agents.
    - Leverage `app/integration/vectordb/` for knowledge base access.
    - Incorporate `app/integration/search/` and `app/integration/scraper/` for research tools.
    - Documentation stubs in `app/integration/documentation/` for API specs.

- **Scalability Considerations**: Design for asynchronous execution (e.g., using asyncio), modular agent registration, and configurable hyperparameters (e.g., via YAML configs).

### High-Level Workflow

The orchestrator will follow a cyclical, adaptive process for handling queries:

1. **Initialization**: Receive user input, initialize state.
2. **Planning Phase**: Route to planners agent to break down the goal.
3. **Execution Loop**:
    - Intelligence evaluates the plan and decides next action.
    - If new info needed: Route to research for gathering, then knowledge for ingestion.
    - If retrieval needed: Route to retrieval for querying the KB.
    - Intelligence synthesizes results; if incomplete, refine plan via planners.
4. **Termination**: Once goal met (e.g., via intelligence validation), generate final output (e.g., RAG-augmented response).
5. **Feedback Loop**: Post-task, knowledge agent updates KB with new learnings.

Example Workflow for a Query like "Summarize latest AI advancements":

- Planners: Decompose into "Search recent sources" -> "Retrieve existing KB" -> "Synthesize".
- Research: Fetch web data.
- Knowledge: Ingest new data.
- Retrieval: Pull relevant KB entries.
- Intelligence: Reason and summarize.
- Orchestrator: Routes based on if data is fresh enough.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Core Abstractions** (`app/agents/core/`):
    - Define BaseAgent class with methods like `execute(task, state) -> output`.
    - Create StateManager for handling shared state.
    - Implement utility functions for prompt templating and tool invocation.

2. **Implement Individual Agents**:
    - For each agent directory: Extend BaseAgent, define specific prompts/tools, and handle inputs/outputs.
    - Test agents in isolation (e.g., via unit tests in Makefile).

3. **Build Orchestrator** (`app/agents/orchestrator/`):
    - Define Orchestrator class initializing the graph.
    - Add nodes for each agent and edges for routing (e.g., planners -> intelligence -> conditional branches).
    - Implement run() method to execute the workflow.

4. **Integrate Tools**:
    - Configure LLM in `app/integration/llm/` (e.g., load model via Hugging Face).
    - Setup vector DB in `app/integration/vectordb/` (e.g., initialize Chroma collection).
    - Wire search/scraper in their dirs.

5. **Testing and Iteration**:
    - Use Makefile for linting, testing, and environment setup.
    - Start with simple workflows, add complexity (e.g., loops).
    - Ensure autonomy: Minimize external dependencies; handle rate limits.

6. **Documentation and Refinement**:
    - Update README.md with architecture diagram (e.g., via Mermaid).
    - Add inline docs in code; use `app/integration/documentation/` for user guides.

This plan ensures a modular, extensible system focused on the orchestrator as the glue, leveraging open-source tools for cost-effective development.
