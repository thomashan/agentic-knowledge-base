# Plan for Building the Autonomous RAG Knowledge-Base Orchestrator

## 1. Define Core Abstractions

At `app/agents/core/`, model the building blocks every agent needs:

- A `Task` interface encapsulating a unique ID, input payload, and metadata (timestamps, priority).
- A `Result` interface capturing outputs, status codes, errors, and links to downstream tasks.
- A `BaseAgent` abstract class with methods `execute(task: Task) -> Result` and hooks for pre-/post-processing.

These core types ensure consistent messaging, logging, and error handling across all agents.

---

## 2. Architect the Orchestrator

At `app/agents/orchestrator/`, implement the workflow engine that:

- Ingests incoming user queries or system events as root Tasks.
- Dispatches subtasks to agents in a configurable sequence.
- Aggregates intermediate Results and routes them to downstream agents.
- Maintains a lightweight in-memory or Redis-backed task registry for state and retries.

Key modules:

- **TaskManager**: queues tasks, tracks states, handles retries.
- **AgentDispatcher**: loads agent classes dynamically (via entry-point discovery or a registry) and calls `execute()`.
- **WorkflowDefinitions**: YAML/JSON files describing pipelines (e.g., Query → Planner → Retrieval → Intelligence).

## 3. Plan Agent-Specific Logic

1. **Planner Agent (`app/agents/planner/`)**
    - Breaks a high-level question into discrete subtasks (e.g., “find definitions,” “summarize section,” “update KB”).
    - Uses an open-source LLM (e.g., Llama-Cpp via `llama-cpp-python` or HuggingFace Transformers) with prompting templates.
    - Emits one `Task` per sub-objective.

2. **Retrieval Agent (`app/agents/retrieval/`)**
    - Queries a vector store (FAISS, Chroma, or Weaviate) using embeddings from OpenAI-style models or open models (e.g., Sentence-Transformers).
    - Returns the top-k documents and their vector scores as a `Result`.

3. **Research Agent (`app/agents/research/`)**
    - When retrieval yields low confidence, fires off web-scraping subtasks via Scrapy or Playwright.
    - Normalizes scraped text, extracts metadata, and returns enriched documents.

4. **Knowledge Agent (`app/agents/knowledge/`)**
    - Takes new or updated documents, embeds them, and upserts into the vector store.
    - Maintains a simple metadata store (SQLite or Postgres) for versioning, provenance, and TTL.

5. **Intelligence Agent (`app/agents/intelligence/`)**
    - Consumes retrieved and/or researched documents plus the original query.
    - Executes a final LLM prompt to synthesize an answer, cite sources, or flag uncertainties.
    - Returns a human-readable response and structured output for downstream UI or logging.

## 4. Define Data Flow & Workflow Examples

Example: User asks, “What’s the latest on quantum-safe cryptography?”

1. Orchestrator receives root `Task(query=…)`.
2. Planner splits into:
    - Task A: “Retrieve background on quantum-safe.”
    - Task B: “Fetch recent research articles.”
3. Retrieval Agent handles Task A → returns KB articles.
4. Research Agent handles Task B → returns scraped abstracts.
5. Knowledge Agent ingests new abstracts into vector DB.
6. Orchestrator collates both Results, submits to Intelligence Agent.
7. Intelligence Agent returns a concise, cited summary.

---

## 5. Integration & Configuration

- Use `environment.yml` to pin Python version, core dependencies (Transformers, FAISS, SQLAlchemy).
- Expose vector DB config, LLM model paths, and scrape targets via a `.env` or config file under `app/integration/`.
- Leverage the Makefile for common workflows: `make setup`, `make lint`, `make test`, `make run-orchestrator`.

---

## 6. CI/CD, Testing & Observability

- Unit-test each agent’s `execute()` method with mock `Task` inputs and stubbed external services.
- Define end-to-end integration tests simulating multi-agent pipelines.
- Instrument TaskManager with Prometheus-compatible metrics (task latency, success rates) and ship logs to ELK or Grafana.

---

## 7. Iteration & Future Enhancements

- Add dynamic pipeline definitions so users can compose custom sequences of agents.
- Introduce an “Evaluator” agent that grades the intelligence agent’s outputs against ground truth.
- Expand the orchestrator to support asynchronous execution, batching, and distributed workers (e.g., using Celery or Ray).

Feel free to tell me which part you’d like to dive deeper into or iterate on next!
