# Agent Orchestrator — Detailed design plan (no code)

Nice — below is a concrete, actionable plan to build an **autonomous RAG knowledge-base** orchestrator that coordinates the five agents you specified (planners, intelligence, knowledge, research, retrieval). I’ll
describe responsibilities, contracts, data models, orchestration flows, failure modes, infra/tooling options, testing and acceptance criteria, and a prioritized set of milestones. No code — only design, decisions, and
clear next steps.

---

# 1 — High-level architecture & responsibilities

**Goal:** accept user queries (or scheduled triggers), run an autonomous RAG workflow, and return grounded, cited answers while continuously expanding and vetting the knowledge base.

Core components:

* **Orchestrator (app/agents/orchestrator/)**

    * Central engine that coordinates agents, tracks session and task state, enforces policies, retries/fallbacks, and returns final responses.
    * Contains scheduler, routing, state manager, policies, and connectors to integration layer (llm, vectordb, scraper, etc.).

* **Core abstractions (app/agents/core/)**

    * Framework-agnostic interfaces, types, workflows, and utilities shared by all agents.
    * Agent contracts (interfaces), data models (Document, Chunk, Embedding, Plan, Task, Finding, Claim, Citation), common utilities (chunking, dedupe, canonical IDs).

* **Agents (app/agents/)**

    * Agent implementations that implement the core interfaces, possibly multiple backends per agent type (e.g., LangChain vs LlamaIndex).
    * Each agent focuses on one capability: planner, intelligence, knowledge, research, retrieval.

* **Integration layer (app/integration/)**

    * Concrete connectors: vector DBs, LLM runtimes, scrapers, search engines, document stores, metrics, tracing.
    * Keeps orchestrator agnostic of vendor details.

---

# 2 — Agent responsibilities & contracts (interface-level)

For each agent type, define **clear interfaces** in `app/agents/core/agent_interfaces.py` (pseudonym: names + responsibilities). Example (semantic, not code):

### Planner agent

* Input: `UserRequest` (query + metadata + optional goals)
* Output: `Plan` — a structured list of steps (e.g., ["retrieve", "research", "summarize", "verify"]) with parameters (queries, top_k, tools).
* Responsibilities:

    * Decompose high-level goals into pipeline steps.
    * Decide whether to use retrieval-only vs retrieval+research vs deep research.
    * Provide stopping criteria, confidence thresholds, and cost constraints.

### Retrieval agent

* Input: `RetrievalQuery` (embedding or text), `top_k`, filters
* Output: `RetrievalResult` — list of `Document` with metadata and similarity scores.
* Responsibilities:

    * Query the vector store + metadata filters, support hybrid search (bm25 + vector).
    * Return provenance metadata (source id, url, chunk id, confidence).

### Research agent

* Input: `ResearchTask` (target topics, allowed sources, depth)
* Output: `Findings` — newly scraped/collected documents, citations, raw snippets.
* Responsibilities:

    * Scrape web, query search engines, run targeted APIs, optionally use headless browser for JS sites.
    * Normalize and dedupe results, attach source metadata and timestamps.

### Knowledge agent

* Input: Documents/Findings
* Output: Stored entries (IDs), enrichment (entities, relations), knowledge graph updates
* Responsibilities:

    * Ingest documents: chunking, embedding, metadata extraction (date, author), canonicalization.
    * Perform entity extraction, claim extraction, fact-check markers, link to existing KB entries.
    * Support update/delete/merge operations; support graph DB or document store view.

### Intelligence agent

* Input: `AnswerTask` (query, context docs, plan, constraints)
* Output: `Answer` (text, structured data, citations, trace)
* Responsibilities:

    * Compose final answer using RAG: prompt templates, chain-of-thought (hidden), hallucination reduction measures.
    * Provide explicit citations anchored to chunks; generate confidence score and suggested follow-up tasks.
    * Post-answer verification (sanity checks, cross-check with high-trust sources).

**Contracts / Shared types** must include:

* `Document {id, source, url, text, chunk_id, embedding_id, created_at}`
* `Citation {doc_id, chunk_id, span_offsets, confidence}`
* `Plan {steps: [Step], metadata}`
* `TaskState` (queued, running, succeeded, failed, retried)
* `Trace` (agent decisions + key outputs) for observability/audit

# 3 — Orchestrator core features & flows

## 3.1 Intake & routing

* Accept inputs:

    * Real-time user query (interactive session)
    * Batch / scheduled job (ingestion, periodic research)
    * System-initiated verification tasks (data curation)
* Normalization: classify intent, languages, safe/unsafe flags.
* Planner asked for `Plan` given the request and context (user profile, session memory, cost constraints).

## 3.2 Execution engine

* Interpret plan as a stateful DAG of steps (support sequential and parallel steps).
* Use a task queue / worker model to run steps via agent adapters.
* Maintain **TaskState** in persistent state store (Redis/Postgres).

## 3.3 Context management & memory

* Session context: conversation history, short-term cache of retrieved docs.
* Long-term memory: knowledge graph and vector index via Knowledge agent.
* Context window management: selective context selection, summarization of older context.

## 3.4 RAG flow (typical)

1. Planner returns plan: e.g., `["retrieve(top_k=10)", "intelligence(summarize)", "if low_confidence -> research & knowledge.ingest & re-run"]`.
2. Orchestrator calls Retrieval agent → gets documents.
3. Orchestrator calls Intelligence agent with prompt + docs → gets draft answer + citations + confidence.
4. If confidence < threshold or missing citations → Orchestrator triggers Research agent to fetch more sources, then Knowledge agent ingests new docs, and the pipeline loops or re-runs final summarization.
5. Final answer returned, with explicit citations and trace.

## 3.5 Verification & safety

* Each final answer goes through a **Verification step**:

    * Cross-check claims against high-trust sources.
    * Flag hallucinatory claims (low overlap with retrieved docs).
    * Add provenance and a “confidence badge” to result.

## 3.6 Logging & traceability

* Complete trace stored per request: plan, retrieval ids, research findings, LLM prompts/responses, verifier decisions.
* Useful for audits, debugging, and human-in-the-loop feedback.

# 4 — Data flow and storage

### Primary stores

* **Vector DB** (FAISS / Milvus / Weaviate / Chroma / PGVector) for embeddings and fast similarity search.
* **Document store / Object store** (S3 / MinIO / Postgres for metadata) to keep original docs and chunks.
* **Knowledge Graph DB** (optional) (Neo4j / AWS Neptune / JanusGraph) for entity relations and lineage, or store graphs as tables.
* **Task/state DB** (Postgres) for orchestrator state, plans, job states.
* **Cache / PubSub** (Redis) for low-latency coordination and in-memory session store.
* **Observability** (Prometheus + Grafana + logs + traces)

### Document lifecycle

1. Raw doc (from scraper, upload, ingestion)
2. Normalize / dedupe
3. Chunk → store chunk text & metadata
4. Embed → store embedding in vector DB with chunk reference
5. Link to KB entries / entities
6. Mark provenance & trust score

---

# 5 — Tooling / open-source options (per concern) & trade-offs

(Provide *options* not prescriptive single choice.)

* **LLM runtimes** (for Intelligence/Planner):

    * Options: local HF transformers / Llama-based models (via `transformers`, `llama.cpp`), Ollama, Docker-hosted open models.
    * Trade-offs: accuracy vs latency vs hardware. Use small/fast models for planning and retrieval augmentation, larger models for final summarization if hardware allows.

* **RAG frameworks / agent frameworks**:

    * LangChain, LlamaIndex (llama_index), Haystack — provide prompts, chains, and connectors.
    * Trade-offs: LangChain is modular; LlamaIndex focuses on indexing and query interfaces; Haystack has built-in pipelines and evaluation tools.

* **Vector DB**:

    * FAISS (local), Milvus (scalable), Weaviate (schema + vector), Chroma (dev friendly), PGVector (Postgres integration).
    * Choose based on scale, persistence, cloud vs self-host, and metadata filtering needs.

* **Scraping / research**:

    * Scrapy, Playwright, Puppeteer for JS sites. Newspaper / readability for extraction.
    * Respect robots.txt and legal/ethical scraping policies.

* **Orchestration / workers**:

    * Celery (Redis/RabbitMQ), RQ, Ray, Prefect, or a Kubernetes Job + message queue.
    * Ray gives convenient parallelism for CPU-heavy tasks; Celery is mature for task queues.

* **Observability**:

    * Prometheus, Grafana, structured logs (ELK/EFK), distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry).

# 6 — Orchestrator internals (what to implement in `app/agents/orchestrator/`)

Suggested modules (high-level list):

* `orchestrator_core` — run loop, planner invocation, DAG executor
* `scheduler` — queues, priorities, rate-limiter, concurrency limits
* `state_manager` — persistent state & checkpoints for tasks
* `agent_adapters` — adapters that call each agent via core interfaces
* `policy_engine` — safety rules, verification thresholds, cost constraints
* `retry_and_fallback` — retry strategies and fallback agent selection
* `tracing_and_audit` — trace builder and exporter
* `observability` — metrics, health checks
* `tests/` — integration & contract tests (mocking agents)
* `cli` / `http_api` — endpoints for tests and local usage

Also declare an `AgentRegistry` (maps agent type -> implementation) so orchestrator can be configured.

---

# 7 — Example request sequence (step-by-step)

User asks: “Is drug X associated with side effect Y?”

1. Intake receives request, normalizes and attaches user profile (if allowed).
2. Planner decides: `["retrieve(top_k=20, filter=trusted_sources)", "intelligence(summarize_and_evaluate)", "if confidence<0.7 -> research(scholarly) & ingest -> rerun"]`.
3. Retrieval returns clinical docs, product pages, news.
4. Intelligence composes answer with citations; confidence = 0.55 (low).
5. Orchestrator triggers Research agent: query PubMed / Google Scholar / domain-specific sources; collects new studies.
6. Knowledge agent ingests these studies (chunk + embed + metadata).
7. Orchestrator re-runs retrieval+intelligence with expanded context.
8. Final answer returned with citations to trials, date stamps, confidence, and suggestion to “consult a clinical professional” (safety policy).

---

# 8 — Failure modes & mitigations

* **Hallucination / Unsupported claims**

    * Mitigation: require that every factual claim has ≥1 high-confidence citation; verification step that cross-checks claim content vs source spans.

* **Long tail / slow research**

    * Mitigation: set timeouts and return best-effort answer with “incomplete” flag; offer human review.

* **Duplicate or noisy ingestion**

    * Mitigation: canonicalization and similarity-based dedupe at ingest (hash + fuzzy match).

* **Cost & latency blowouts**

    * Mitigation: Planner can enforce budget/cost constraints and choose cheaper models or reduce top_k.

* **Broken external connectors**

    * Mitigation: circuit breakers, exponential backoff, offline cached sources fallback.

---

# 9 — Testing, evaluation & acceptance criteria

### Tests to implement (no code here — test specs)

* **Unit / contract tests** for each agent interface (mocked).
* **Integration tests**: full RAG flow with a small dataset (ingest -> retrieve -> answer).
* **Regression tests**: sample queries and golden answers with allowed variance.
* **Load tests**: simulate concurrent requests to ensure throttling and graceful degradation.
* **Safety tests**: inject prompts designed to cause hallucination or policy violations and verify safeguards.

### Metrics to track

* Answer latency (ms)
* Retrieval recall@k / precision@k
* Answer confidence distribution
* Grounding rate: % claims with direct supporting citations
* Ingest throughput (docs/min)
* Failure rates by component
* Cost per query (if using paid models)

### Acceptance criteria (example)

* Final answers must list citations for ≥90% of factual claims (configurable).
* System recovers from connector outage by returning cached results or graceful error.
* Planner + Orchestrator re-run logic successfully improves confidence in ≥70% of reruns where initial confidence < threshold.

# 10 — Operational & security considerations

* **Access control & auditing**: all calls/logs should be auditable; redact PII in logs.
* **Rate limits**: per-user and per-model limits.
* **Data retention & GDPR**: retention policy for scraped sources and user sessions.
* **Robots & copyright**: respect robots.txt, rate limits, and content use policies.
* **Secrets**: store credentials for external services in vault (HashiCorp Vault / K8s secrets).
* **Backups**: vector DB backups and metadata snapshotting.

---

# 11 — Prioritized milestones & deliverables (no time-estimates)

**Milestone A — Foundations**

* Create core interfaces & data models in `app/agents/core/`.
* Implement simple orchestrator kernel with TaskState and simple DAG execution.
* Implement Retrieval adapter that can query a chosen local vector DB and return Document objects.
* Acceptance: orchestrator can run a simple plan: `retrieve -> intelligence(mock)`.

**Milestone B — Knowledge ingestion**

* Build Knowledge agent: chunking, embedding pipeline, store to vector DB, metadata persistence.
* Ingest a seed corpus and verify retrieval results are correct.
* Acceptance: ingested docs return at top of retrieval for matched queries.

**Milestone C — Intelligence & Planner**

* Implement Planner agent (rule-based initially) and Intelligence agent wired to an LLM runtime.
* Implement RAG prompt templates and citation anchoring.
* Acceptance: returning an answer with inline citations from retrieved chunks.

**Milestone D — Research & verification**

* Add Research agent with web scraping and search connectors.
* Add verification step and feedback loop to re-ingest and re-run when confidence low.
* Acceptance: system automatically triggers research when confidence threshold not met and improves answer grounding.

**Milestone E — Observability, scaling & safety**

* Add metrics, tracing, circuit breakers, and policy engine.
* Harden for concurrency and add tests.
* Acceptance: system remains stable under target load and passes safety tests.

---

# 12 — Testing scenarios & sample acceptance queries

* Simple factual: “When was company X founded?” → should return date + citation to an authoritative doc.
* Ambiguous query: “Is treatment Y effective for condition Z?” → should return balanced answer with multiple citations and confidence.
* Ongoing research query: “What’s new about topic T this month?” → system should run research agent and return latest findings with timestamps.

---

# 13 — Observability, UX & human-in-the-loop

* Present to user:

    * Answer, confidence, and citations (clickable).
    * “Why this answer” — short trace (which docs used).
    * Feedback widget (correct/incorrect) that creates a verification job for humans.
* Human review workflow: flagged answers get queued to content reviewers, who can accept/reject and trigger KB updates.

---

# 14 — Risks, open questions & suggested trade-offs to decide now

* **Model choices**: local open models vs hosted LLMs — affects latency, cost, and accuracy.
* **Vector DB**: choose FAISS for local dev; choose Milvus or Weaviate for scale.
* **Verification sources**: define what counts as “trusted” (Wikipedia? PubMed? news outlets?).

Decide: whether Knowledge agent will include a graph DB (adds complexity but enables relation queries) or remain document-only initially.

---

# 15 — Summary / One-page action plan (next concrete steps)

1. Define core data models & agent interfaces in `app/agents/core/`.
2. Scaffold orchestrator kernel and TaskState with a minimal DAG executor in `app/agents/orchestrator/`.
3. Implement Retrieval agent + choose a vector DB (FAISS for dev).
4. Implement Knowledge agent ingestion pipeline (chunk + embed + index).
5. Wire a simple Intelligence agent using a local or hosted LLM and RAG prompt template.
6. Implement Planner (rule-based) and basic loop: plan → retrieve → intelligence → verify → return.
7. Add tests, tracing, and safety checks.
8. Incrementally add Research agent and automatic re-ingestion loop.

If you want, I can next:

* produce the exact interface definitions (method names, input/output schemas and JSON examples) to drop into `app/agents/core/` (no code, justIDL-style), **or**
* create an itemized file-by-file TODO for `app/agents/orchestrator/` and the core folder showing exact filenames and brief responsibilities for each file.

Which one would you like me to produce now?
