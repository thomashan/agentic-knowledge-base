# **An Architectural Blueprint for a Pluggable Agentic Orchestration System**

## **Section 1: System Architecture and Core Principles**

### **1.1. Introduction and Strategic Imperative**

The domain of artificial intelligence is characterized by rapid innovation, particularly in the development of agentic frameworks designed to orchestrate autonomous AI agents. This proliferation has given rise to a
vibrant but fragmented ecosystem, with powerful, distinct frameworks such as CrewAI and LangChain's LangGraph emerging as prominent solutions.1 CrewAI, for instance, is an open-source framework focused on role-based,
multi-agent collaboration, built entirely independent of other agent frameworks.1 In parallel, LangGraph offers a low-level, highly controllable framework for building stateful agents and custom workflows, emphasizing a
graph-based cognitive architecture.2

The divergence in philosophy and implementation between these frameworks presents a significant strategic risk for any organization building long-term, enterprise-grade agentic systems: framework lock-in. Committing an
entire application's logic to the specific APIs and paradigms of a single framework makes it costly and complex to adapt to new, potentially superior technologies or to leverage the unique strengths of different
frameworks for different tasks.

The primary objective of this architectural plan is to mitigate this risk by establishing a stable, internal core of abstract interfaces that decouple the application's business logic from the concrete implementation
details of any single orchestration framework. The proposed system will treat specific frameworks as interchangeable "plugins" or "adapters," enabling the application to evolve and adapt with the broader AI ecosystem.
This approach ensures architectural longevity, flexibility, and maintainability in a volatile technological landscape.

### **1.2. The Adapter Pattern as an Architectural North Star**

To achieve the desired separation of concerns, this architecture will be formally modeled on the **Adapter Pattern**. This structural design pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another
interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

In the context of this project, the directory structure reflects this pattern directly:

* app/agents/core/: This directory will contain the target interfaces—a set of Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) that define the system's internal, framework-agnostic model of agents, tasks, and orchestration.
* app/agents/orchestrator/: This directory will house the Adapters. Each subdirectory (e.g., crewai/, langchain/) will contain a concrete implementation of the core orchestration interface that translates the system's
  abstract concepts into the specific API calls and objects of the target framework.

The flow of control within this architecture is unidirectional and clearly defined. The application's business logic interacts exclusively with the core interfaces. When an orchestration process is initiated, the core
interface delegates the call to the currently configured adapter (e.g., CrewAIOrchestrator). This adapter is then responsible for instantiating and managing the underlying framework's components (e.g., a crewai.Crew
object) to execute the request. The result is then translated back from the framework-specific format into a standardized, abstract data model before being returned to the application. This strict boundary prevents any
framework-specific concepts from "leaking" into the higher-level business logic.

### **1.3. Core Design Principles**

The architecture is founded on a set of guiding principles to ensure its robustness, scalability, and long-term viability.

* **Framework Agnosticism:** The paramount principle is that the core system and the business logic built upon it must remain entirely unaware of the specific orchestration framework being used. All interactions must
  occur through the defined abstract interfaces. This ensures that switching from CrewAI to LangGraph, for example, is a matter of changing a configuration value, not rewriting application code.
* **Modularity and Extensibility:** The system is designed for growth. Adding support for a new orchestration framework should be a self-contained task. A developer would create a new subdirectory under
  app/agents/orchestrator/, implement a new adapter class that conforms to the AbstractOrchestrator interface, and make it available for selection in the system's configuration. No modifications to the core interfaces or
  existing adapters are required.
* **Testability:** The abstraction layer provides a significant advantage for testing. A MockOrchestrator can be easily implemented for use in unit and integration tests. This mock adapter can simulate agent interactions
  and return predictable results without making any actual LLM calls or depending on external libraries. This dramatically reduces the cost, latency, and flakiness of the test suite, enabling robust and efficient
  validation of the application's logic.
* **Configuration-Driven:** The selection and parameterization of the orchestrator, its underlying LLMs, and other operational parameters must be managed through a centralized configuration mechanism (e.g., environment
  variables or configuration files), not through hardcoded logic. This allows for dynamic selection of orchestration strategies and easy management of settings across different environments (development, staging,
  production).

### **1.4. Mapping Framework Concepts to a Unified Core Model**

The feasibility of this abstraction rests on the observation that, despite their differences, modern agentic frameworks share a common set of fundamental primitives. A critical step in designing the core interfaces is to
identify these common concepts and map them to a unified, framework-agnostic model.

Analysis of frameworks like CrewAI and LangGraph reveals a clear overlap in core components. Both have concepts of **Agents** (specialized actors), **Tasks** (units of work), and **Tools** (capabilities for interacting
with the external world).3 This shared foundation is the key enabler for creating meaningful, cross-compatible abstractions for these entities.

The most significant divergence lies in the **Orchestration Model**.

* **CrewAI** employs a high-level, declarative approach through its Process attribute. The developer specifies a strategy, such as sequential or hierarchical, and the framework manages the flow of execution accordingly.7
  This model is intuitive and mirrors human team structures.1
* **LangGraph**, conversely, uses a low-level, imperative model. The developer must explicitly define the workflow as a stateful graph, connecting nodes (steps) with edges (transitions).2 This provides granular control
  and supports complex, non-linear, and cyclical workflows but requires more programmatic effort.

A naive abstraction might be biased towards the simpler, declarative model of CrewAI, for example, by defining an execute(tasks) method that implicitly assumes a linear sequence. Such a design would severely limit the
capabilities of a LangGraph adapter, preventing it from leveraging its core strengths in parallelization and custom routing.8

Therefore, the core abstraction must be designed with the flexibility to accommodate both paradigms. The AbstractOrchestrator interface will be defined in a way that allows the concrete implementation to interpret a
collection of agents and tasks in the manner best suited to its underlying model. The CrewAIOrchestrator will interpret a set of tasks as the input for a Crew and its Process. The future LangGraphOrchestrator will
interpret that same set of tasks—along with their declared dependencies—as a blueprint for compiling a Graph. This design choice is fundamental to the architecture's success and is reflected in the detailed interface
definitions in Section 2\.

To clarify these relationships for developers working within the system, the following conceptual mapping is provided.

| Framework Concept   | CrewAI Equivalent                  | LangGraph Equivalent            | Core Abstraction                |
|:--------------------|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| **Execution Unit**  | Agent                              | Agentic Node/Function           | AbstractAgent                   |
| **Work Definition** | Task                               | Node/Step in Graph              | AbstractTask                    |
| **Capability**      | Tool                               | Tool                            | AbstractTool                    |
| **Team/Group**      | Crew                               | Graph / CompiledGraph           | AbstractOrchestrator (instance) |
| **Execution Model** | Process (Sequential, Hierarchical) | Graph Definition (Nodes, Edges) | Orchestrator Configuration      |
| **Final Result**    | CrewOutput                         | Final Graph State               | ExecutionResult                 |

## **Section 2: The Agnostic Core: Abstract Interfaces and Data Models (app/agents/core/)**

This section presents the technical specification for the abstract classes and data models that constitute the stable, framework-agnostic core of the system. These definitions serve as the definitive contract for all
components interacting with the agentic orchestration layer.

### **2.1. core/models.py: Standardized Data Structures**

To ensure that the output of any orchestration process is consistent and predictable, regardless of the underlying framework, a set of standardized data transfer objects will be defined using the Pydantic library. This
approach provides robust data validation, serialization, and clear data contracts.

**ExecutionResult Data Model**

This model is the primary data structure for returning the outcome of an orchestration run. Its design is heavily influenced by the well-structured CrewOutput class from CrewAI, which provides a comprehensive summary of
the execution.9 By standardizing on a similar structure, the system guarantees that consuming applications can reliably access results in various formats.

Python

\# app/agents/core/models.py

from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional  
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class TaskExecutionRecord(BaseModel):  
"""  
A record of the output from a single task execution.  
"""  
task\_description: str \= Field(..., description="The original description of the task.")  
raw\_output: str \= Field(..., description="The raw string output of the task.")  
structured\_output: Optional\] \= Field(None, description="Structured output, if available.")

class ExecutionResult(BaseModel):  
"""  
A standardized data model for the final result of an agentic orchestration.  
This model ensures a consistent output format regardless of the underlying  
orchestration framework (e.g., CrewAI, LangGraph).  
"""  
raw\_output: str \= Field(  
...,  
description="The final, raw string output from the entire orchestration process."  
)  
structured\_output: Optional\] \= Field(  
None,  
description="The final output parsed into a structured dictionary, if applicable."  
)  
task\_outputs: List \= Field(  
default\_factory=list,  
description="A list of outputs from each individual task executed during the run."  
)  
metadata: Dict\[str, Any\] \= Field(  
default\_factory=dict,  
description=(  
"A dictionary containing metadata about the execution, such as token usage, "  
"execution time, cost, etc."  
)  
)

### **2.2. core/abc.py: The Core Contracts**

This file contains the Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) that define the core contracts of the system. Using Python's abc module enforces that any concrete implementation (i.e., an adapter for a specific framework) must
adhere to these defined interfaces.

**AbstractTool(ABC)**

This class provides a minimal, universal interface for any tool that an agent can utilize. Its simplicity ensures compatibility with the tool definitions in both CrewAI and LangChain.6

Python

\# app/agents/core/abc.py

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod  
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional

from.models import ExecutionResult

class AbstractTool(ABC):  
"""  
Abstract interface for a tool that can be used by an agent.  
"""  
@property  
@abstractmethod  
def name(self) \-\> str:  
"""The unique name of the tool."""  
pass

    @property  
    @abstractmethod  
    def description(self) \-\> str:  
        """A clear description of what the tool does and its parameters."""  
        pass

    @abstractmethod  
    def execute(self, \*\*kwargs: Any) \-\> Any:  
        """Executes the tool with the given arguments."""  
        pass

**AbstractAgent(ABC)**

This class defines the identity, purpose, and capabilities of an agent in a framework-agnostic manner. The attributes are derived from the common characteristics identified in frameworks like CrewAI, which emphasize
role-based agent design with specific goals and backstories to enhance performance.1 This class primarily serves as a structured data container that adapters will use to configure concrete agent objects.

Python

\# app/agents/core/abc.py (continued)

class AbstractAgent(ABC):  
"""  
Abstract definition of an agent, capturing its identity and capabilities  
in a framework-agnostic way.  
"""  
@property  
@abstractmethod  
def role(self) \-\> str:  
"""The specific role of the agent (e.g., 'Senior Researcher')."""  
pass

    @property  
    @abstractmethod  
    def goal(self) \-\> str:  
        """The primary objective of the agent."""  
        pass

    @property  
    @abstractmethod  
    def backstory(self) \-\> str:  
        """A narrative background for the agent to provide context."""  
        pass

    @property  
    @abstractmethod  
    def tools(self) \-\> List:  
        """A list of tools the agent is equipped with."""  
        pass

    @property  
    @abstractmethod  
    def llm\_config(self) \-\> Optional\]:  
        """Configuration for the language model, if specific to this agent."""  
        pass

**AbstractTask(ABC)**

This class defines a single unit of work. It includes a description of the task, the expected output format, and a reference to the agent responsible for its execution.

Crucially, to ensure the architecture is not biased towards simple, linear workflows and remains viable for more advanced graph-based frameworks, this interface includes an optional dependencies attribute. A simple
sequential orchestrator, like the initial CrewAI adapter, may simply use the order of task addition to determine execution flow. However, the presence of this explicit dependency graph is essential for a more
sophisticated adapter, such as one for LangGraph, to construct complex workflows involving parallel execution and conditional routing.8 This design choice future-proofs the core abstraction, ensuring it can accommodate
both declarative and imperative orchestration paradigms without modification.

Python

\# app/agents/core/abc.py (continued)

class AbstractTask(ABC):  
"""  
Abstract definition of a task to be performed by an agent.  
"""  
@property  
@abstractmethod

        """  
        A list of other tasks that must be completed before this one can start.  
        This is crucial for defining non-sequential workflows.  
        """  
        pass

**AbstractOrchestrator(ABC)**

This class is the cornerstone of the entire abstraction layer. It defines the universal interface for configuring and executing a collection of agents and tasks. Any framework-specific adapter must implement this
interface.

Python

\# app/agents/core/abc.py (continued)

class AbstractOrchestrator(ABC):

        :return: An ExecutionResult object with a standardized format.  
        """  
        pass

## **Section 3: Initial Implementation: The CrewAI Orchestrator Adapter (app/agents/orchestrator/crewai/)**

This section provides a concrete implementation plan for the CrewAIOrchestrator, the first adapter that will bridge the abstract core interfaces with the CrewAI framework. This implementation will serve as a reference
for all future adapters.

### **3.1. crewai/adapter.py: The CrewAIOrchestrator Class**

The CrewAIOrchestrator class will be a concrete implementation of the AbstractOrchestrator. Its primary responsibility is to translate the abstract AbstractAgent and AbstractTask objects into their corresponding
crewai.Agent and crewai.Task counterparts and to manage the lifecycle of a crewai.Crew.

**Mapping Core to Concrete**

* **\_\_init\_\_:** The constructor will receive a configuration dictionary. It will parse this dictionary to extract CrewAI-specific settings such as the desired process (e.g., sequential or hierarchical), manager\_llm
  configuration for hierarchical processes, and memory settings.7 These settings will be stored as instance attributes for later use.
* **add\_agent:** This method will accept an AbstractAgent object. Inside the method, it will instantiate a crewai.Agent, mapping the properties from the abstract object directly to the parameters of the crewai.Agent
  constructor (e.g., role=agent.role, goal=agent.goal, backstory=agent.backstory). The created crewai.Agent instance will be stored in an internal list, self.\_crewai\_agents.
* **add\_task:** Similarly, this method will accept an AbstractTask object. It will instantiate a crewai.Task by mapping the description and expected\_output properties. It will also look up the corresponding
  crewai.Agent from its internal list to assign the task correctly. The resulting crewai.Task object will be appended to an internal self.\_crewai\_tasks list.

The internal state of a CrewAIOrchestrator instance will thus consist of the parsed configuration and two lists: one holding the concrete crewai.Agent objects and another holding the crewai.Task objects, ready for
execution.

### **3.2. Implementing the execute Method**

The execute method is the heart of the adapter, where the actual orchestration is initiated and the results are standardized. The implementation will follow a clear, three-step process.

* **Step 1: Instantiate the Crew:** The method will first create an instance of the crewai.Crew class. It will pass the internally stored lists of agents and tasks (self.\_crewai\_agents, self.\_crewai\_tasks) to the
  constructor. It will also pass any relevant configuration parameters that were parsed in the \_\_init\_\_ method, such as process, manager\_llm, or memory.7 For example:  
  crew \= Crew(agents=self.\_crewai\_agents, tasks=self.\_crewai\_tasks, process=self.config.get('process', Process.sequential)).
* **Step 2: Kickoff Execution:** With the Crew object configured and instantiated, the method will call crew.kickoff() to start the agentic workflow. This call is blocking and will return only when the crew has completed
  all its assigned tasks.
* **Step 3: Adapt the Output:** The kickoff method returns a CrewOutput object.9 The final and most critical step for this adapter is to translate this framework-specific output into the system's standardized  
  ExecutionResult data model. This involves a meticulous one-to-one mapping of fields: the raw output from CrewOutput will populate ExecutionResult.raw\_output, token\_usage will go into ExecutionResult.metadata, and the
  list of tasks\_output will be transformed into a list of TaskExecutionRecord objects. This final translation enforces the abstraction boundary and ensures the application layer receives a consistent, predictable
  result.

### **3.3. Handling Configuration and Dependencies**

Effective configuration is key to the adapter's flexibility. A sample configuration dictionary for the CrewAIOrchestrator would look as follows:

JSON

{  
"process": "hierarchical",  
"manager\_llm": {  
"provider": "openai",  
"model": "gpt-4-turbo"  
},  
"memory": true,  
"cache": true,  
"embedder": {  
"provider": "openai"  
}  
}

This configuration demonstrates how to specify the execution process and configure underlying services like LLMs and embedders, leveraging CrewAI's support for various providers.1

Python dependencies will be managed to ensure modularity. The crewai library and its optional extras, such as crewai\[tools\], will be defined as optional dependency groups in the project's pyproject.toml file.10 This
allows users of the system to install the CrewAI-specific dependencies only if they intend to use the

CrewAIOrchestrator, keeping the core installation lightweight.

## **Section 4: Architectural Validation: A Design for the LangGraph Orchestrator**

To validate the robustness and framework-agnostic nature of the core architecture, this section outlines a design for a second adapter: the LangGraphOrchestrator. By demonstrating that the core interfaces can effectively
support a philosophically different framework like LangGraph, we can confirm that the abstraction is sound and not unintentionally biased towards CrewAI's declarative model.

### **4.1. Bridging the Orchestration Paradigm Gap**

The primary architectural challenge is to map the system's abstract definition of tasks and dependencies onto LangGraph's imperative, stateful graph model. LangGraph is a "low-level orchestration framework" designed for
building custom, long-running, and stateful agentic workflows.4 It does not have a simple "run these tasks" function; instead, it requires the developer to construct and compile a graph that represents the desired
logic.2

The LangGraphOrchestrator adapter must therefore act as a "graph compiler." It will take the list of AbstractTask objects, along with their dependency information, and dynamically construct a corresponding
langgraph.graph.StatefulGraph that implements the intended workflow. The design of the AbstractTask interface, specifically the inclusion of the dependencies property, is the critical enabler for this process.

### **4.2. The LangGraphOrchestrator Design Proposal**

The implementation of the LangGraphOrchestrator would differ significantly from its CrewAI counterpart, particularly within the execute method.

* The add\_agent and add\_task methods will function similarly, storing the abstract objects in internal lists without immediate translation.
* The execute method will be a multi-step compilation and execution process:
    1. **Graph Scaffolding:** Initialize a langgraph.graph.StatefulGraph. A Pydantic or TypedDict object will be defined to represent the state of the graph, which will track the outputs of completed tasks and any other
       necessary information for routing and final result synthesis.
    2. **Node Compilation:** Iterate through the internal list of AbstractTask objects. For each task, create a corresponding graph node. A node in LangGraph is typically a function or a Runnable. This function will
       encapsulate the logic for executing the task: invoking the assigned agent's LLM with the task description and providing it with the necessary tools.
    3. **Edge Compilation:** This is the most critical step. The orchestrator will analyze the dependencies attribute of each AbstractTask. If TaskC declares a dependency on TaskA and TaskB, the adapter will add edges to
       the graph from the nodes representing TaskA and TaskB to the node for TaskC. If no dependencies are specified for any tasks, the adapter can default to creating a simple sequential graph by adding an edge from
       each task to the next in the list. This step directly translates the abstract dependency information into the concrete structure of the execution graph. It also allows for the construction of parallel workflows, a
       key feature of LangGraph.8
    4. **Graph Compilation and Execution:** Once all nodes and edges have been added, the adapter will call graph.compile() to create an executable Runnable object. This compiled graph represents the complete,
       ready-to-run agentic workflow.
    5. **Invocation and Output Adaptation:** The adapter will then call .invoke() or .stream() on the compiled graph to begin execution.6 Upon completion, the final state of the graph will contain the outputs of all
       tasks. The adapter's final job is to traverse this state object and populate the standardized  
       ExecutionResult model, ensuring its output is indistinguishable from that of the CrewAIOrchestrator to the calling application.

### **4.3. Proving the Abstraction's Value**

This design for a LangGraphOrchestrator serves as a powerful validation of the core architecture. It demonstrates that the abstract interfaces, particularly AbstractTask with its dependencies field, are not merely
sufficient but are actively *enabling*. They provide the necessary semantic information for a sophisticated adapter to leverage the full power of a graph-based framework, including its support for custom control flows,
parallelization, and stateful execution.2

This proves that the proposed architecture is not a "leaky" abstraction biased towards a single framework's paradigm. Instead, it is a genuinely flexible and future-proof foundation capable of accommodating a diverse
range of agentic orchestration models.

## **Section 5: Implementation Roadmap and Strategic Recommendations**

This final section outlines an actionable, phased implementation plan and provides strategic recommendations to ensure the project's long-term success, maintainability, and alignment with best practices in software and
MLOps engineering.

### **5.1. Phased Implementation Roadmap**

A phased approach is recommended to manage complexity and deliver value incrementally.

* **Phase 1: Core Foundation (Estimated 1-2 Sprints)**
    * **Task 1:** Implement all Pydantic data models in app/agents/core/models.py, including ExecutionResult and TaskExecutionRecord.
    * **Task 2:** Define all Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in app/agents/core/abc.py as specified in Section 2.2.
    * **Task 3:** Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the core components. These tests should validate the data models and can use a simple mock implementation of the ABCs to ensure the contracts are
      well-defined and enforced.
* **Phase 2: CrewAI Integration (Estimated 2-3 Sprints)**
    * **Task 1:** Implement the CrewAIOrchestrator adapter in app/agents/orchestrator/crewai/adapter.py.
    * **Task 2:** Develop integration tests for the adapter. These tests should use the CrewAIOrchestrator to run a simple, multi-agent crew. To isolate the tests and reduce costs, they should be configured to use a mock
      or a fast, inexpensive LLM.
    * **Task 3:** Write clear documentation on how to configure and use the CrewAIOrchestrator, including example configuration files.
* **Phase 3: Demonstration and Refinement (Estimated 1 Sprint)**
    * **Task 1:** Build a sample application or proof-of-concept within the agentic-knowledge-base project. This application should use the fully implemented system (core interfaces \+ CrewAI adapter) to solve a concrete
      business problem, such as a research-and-summarize workflow.
    * **Task 2:** Based on the experience of building the sample application, review and refine the core interfaces and configuration mechanisms to improve ergonomics and address any unforeseen issues.

### **5.2. Strategic Recommendations**

To enhance the robustness and usability of the system, the following strategic practices are recommended.

**Dependency Injection for LLMs**

The system should avoid hardcoding LLM clients or providers. The configuration dictionary passed to an orchestrator's constructor should be the single source of truth for LLM selection. The adapter should be responsible
for dynamically instantiating the correct LLM client (e.g., from langchain\_openai, langchain\_anthropic, langchain\_google\_genai) based on this configuration. This practice keeps the core system and the adapters clean
of specific SDKs and allows for maximum flexibility in model selection.6

**Centralized Configuration**

It is strongly recommended to use a dedicated library for managing configuration, such as Pydantic's BaseSettings. This allows all system-wide settings—including API keys, the choice of orchestrator, default LLM models,
and logging levels—to be loaded from environment variables or a .env file. This centralizes configuration management, making it easy to operate the system across different environments without code changes.

**Abstracting Observability**

Both CrewAI and LangGraph offer strong observability features. CrewAI provides logging capabilities and integrations with platforms like Langfuse and Phoenix, while LangGraph integrates deeply with LangSmith for detailed
tracing of agent execution.4 To avoid fragmented and inconsistent monitoring, the architecture can be enhanced by making observability a first-class, abstract concept.

This can be achieved by extending the AbstractOrchestrator interface to accept an optional, standardized Tracer or Logger object in its constructor. This object would conform to a simple, internally defined interface (
e.g., with methods like on\_task\_start, on\_agent\_step, on\_tool\_use). The concrete adapter (CrewAIOrchestrator, LangGraphOrchestrator) would then be responsible for wiring up the underlying framework's native
callbacks (e.g., CrewAI's step\_callback or LangGraph's tracing mechanisms) to this provided Tracer object. This approach provides the application with a single, unified view of agent execution traces, creating a "single
pane of glass" for monitoring, debugging, and performance analysis, regardless of which backend is orchestrating the workflow.

| mode: 'sequential'                             | process=Process.sequential              | Compiles a linear graph where each task depends on the previous one. | This is the expected default behavior for simple workflows.   |
| mode: 'hierarchical'                           | process=Process.hierarchical            | Compiles a manager-worker graph topology.                            | Requires a manager\_llm to be specified in the configuration. |
| memory: {...}                                  | memory=... (e.g., Memory(embedder=...)) | Configures the Checkpointer for the graph to enable persistence.     | The structure of the memory config object may vary.           |
| llm\_provider: {...}                           | Passed to Agent and Crew LLM settings.  | Passed to nodes for their individual LLM calls.                      | Defines the default LLM to be used across the workflow.       |
