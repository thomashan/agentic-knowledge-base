## Overall System Recommendations

### Recommended Stack:

1. **Orchestration:** LangGraph for agent coordination
2. **Research:** SearXNG + Playwright combination
3. **LLM:** Ollama with Llama 3.1 or Mistral models
4. **Documentation:** Outline for structured knowledge base
5. **Vector DB:** Qdrant for embeddings storage
6. **Embeddings:** BGE-large or Sentence-Transformers
7. **Deployment:** Docker Compose for initial setup, migrate to K3s when scaling

### Architecture Flow:

```
Planner Agent (LangGraph)
    ↓
Research Agents (Multiple instances)
    - Web Search (SearXNG)
    - Browser Automation (Playwright)
    - API Clients (Custom)
    ↓
Intelligence Agent (Ollama + Llama 3.1)
    - Summarization
    - Structuring
    - Writing
    ↓
Knowledge Agent
    - Write to Outline (via API)
    - Version tracking
    - Update Vector DB (Qdrant)
    ↓
Retrieval Agent
    - Hybrid search (Vector + BM25)
    - Context assembly
    - Reranking
```

### Key Design Decisions:

**Abstraction Layers:**

- Create adapter interfaces for each component (LLM, Vector DB, Documentation)
- Use dependency injection for swappable components
- Implement standard message formats between agents

**Scalability Approach:**

- Stateless research agents that can be spawned on-demand
- Message queue (RabbitMQ/Redis) for agent communication
- Separate read/write paths for documentation

**Monitoring:**

- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- Structured logging with vector.dev

This architecture provides flexibility, scalability, and complete open-source compliance while maintaining the ability to swap components as needed.
